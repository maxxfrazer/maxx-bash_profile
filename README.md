maxx-bash_profile
=================

My bash profile (and similar) filled with functions I've made and aliases gathered from various places.

run install.command to append .bash_profile with a single line or create if it doesn't exist yet.
The single line will tell your .bash_profile to include a file called .extra_profile, and this 

.gitconfig contents to be added to the bottom of your existing .gitconfig file


both files are hidden due to starting with a period, ls -li should display them in terminal.
use '$ subl .' to open all files in sublime text




recommended to install, assuming user already has sublime text:


[Sublime text 2 OS X Command Line](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html)


OR

[Sublime text 3 OS X Command Line](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html)
